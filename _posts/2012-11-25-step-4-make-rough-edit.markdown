Alright, your video has now been shot.  Now what? In this section, we’ll talk about creating a “rough edit” that will give you a general sense of how the different parts of your masterpiece will come together into a finished whole.

*We’ll be talking about iMovie in this step, but if you are working on a Windows machine, much of what we describe here also applies to Windows Movie Maker.*

## Choosing your software

There are so many programs that you can use to edit video. It's a little overwhelming. Luckily both Windows and Mac come with pretty decent (and free) video editors--Windows Movie Maker and iMovie. If you're just getting the hang for shooting and editing, it's probably a good idea to start with the free offerings and then graduate to the more complex programs like Final Cut or Premiere Pro.

If you have a Skokie Public Library, you can get help with Windows Movie Maker or iMovie right at home. Try out Atomic Training's video tutorials to get you started. We also have access to Lynda.com *here at the library*.

## Making the rough cut

Once you know how to navigate the editing program you chose, it's time to make a rough cut. The goal with a rough cut is to get your footage organized and the basic scenes cut and in place.

Remember, it's just a draft of your final project, so don't be afraid if it isn't perfect the first time. Having something to look at and critique is better than nothing.

Once you have your rough edit and are happy with it, it'll be time to clean it up and make it shine. We'll give you some ideas in [step 5]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts/step-5-fine-tuning-with-titles-transitions-music/).
