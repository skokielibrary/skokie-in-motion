The video is now ready for your final touches: adding titles, adding transitions, and music.  I will also touch on some of the other super-fancy things you can (and maybe should, probably shouldn’t) do with your mov.

## Titles

It might seem silly to remind you to add titles to you movies, but they are an important component to the look and feel of your movie. They also convey important information like who made the movie. Also, be sure to thank anyone who helped you out with the movie. No sense in letting things go to your head.

Also, if you have used any music, footage, or images that need crediting, don't forget to include that in your titles (probably at the end) too.

## Transitions

Transitions are used to, well, transition from one shot to the next.  For example, you can transition from a family member telling a story about how you moved to Skokie to still images or video from Moving Day. Jumping from one to the next can be jarring for the viewer, so adding transitions can add to the quality of the entire video. Many, many types of transitions are available… I highly recommend using only ones that are not to, ahem, thematic.  Perhaps the Cross Dissolve or Cross Zoom or Fade to Black will work?

## Music and sound

The last “necessary” edit you need to do is to add background music. We generally only add background music to the beginning and end of the videos, but you are free to add it where you think it is needed.

I also like to add sound effects. It’s tempting to put these everywhere, but generally it’s best to use them sparingly.

## Other goodness

Extra credit and extra fun time. Feel free to add them if you think it will help the final product.

### Photos

Making a movie out of photos is one of the main uses of iMovie that we’ve seen in our Digital Media Lab.  People can upload a bunch of images, add some music, transitions, titles, and use iMovie to make a pretty cool dynamic slideshow.

### Voice Overs

If you plan on using voice overs make sure to use a decent microphone in a quiet place.  Voice overs are especially useful if you plan on not having a person be in the video at all.

### Slow motion, fast forward, rewind, flash and hold etc.

These cool but somewhat flashy special effects are available to you as well.  Try them out.  Once again, it’s probably a good idea to use these sparingly, but if you deploy them at the right moment your video could really pop.

### Greenscreen

If you think having an interesting background such as water, stars, a waving flag, or a color is what is needed then try out greenscreen.
