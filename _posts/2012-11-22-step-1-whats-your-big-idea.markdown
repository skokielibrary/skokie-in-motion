Before the cameras roll, before you’ve scouted your first location, before you’ve even written a script, you’ve got to have an idea for your video. If you can come up with a good message for the viewer, you can use that message as a litmus test for all the nitty-gritty details of your video.

What constitutes a good idea for a video? You’re free to use your imagination here, but since Skokie in Motion is an all-ages event, we do ask that they be “PG” rated at the maximum. Some potential ideas might include:

- A filmed version of your favorite short story
- A music video for a song you’ve written, or a performance for your band
- Your unique spin on a popular Internet meme, a la “Gangnam Style” or “Call Me Maybe”
- A well-edited video of your cat/child/school mascot doing something adorable
- A family history, featuring a story told by a relative and accented with other video footage or still photos
