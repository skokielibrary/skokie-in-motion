Congratulations! You’ve finished your masterpiece. All you have left to do is get the product to us, either on DVD or flash drive.

Of course, doing this is not quite as simple as hitting “Save As.” The Project – which is what you’ve been working in so far – is not so much of an individual file as it is an index for all of the individual pieces that you’ve been using. All the individual video clips, all the photos, all the audio is organized and put in order by the project file. In order to turn all of those intricately moving parts into one finished video clip, you’ve got to export the project into a finished file. Here’s what you need to do:

1. Click on Share, like you see at right.
2. Select Export Movie. (You can also use Command+E to do this directly.)
3. Select your video quality. Remember, there’s a tradeoff between file size and film quality. Any recordable DVD or jump drive larger than 1GB should give you more than enough space to work with.
4. Give your film a name and Export the finished file.

You’re now ready to submit your film to Skokie in Motion! Good luck!
