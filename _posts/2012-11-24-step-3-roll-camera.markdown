## Basic video techniques

Before you grab the gear and go on location, take some time to review some simple techniques for getting the good shot. The folks at New Video Monday have published a few short, animated tutorials on creating videos for the Web. Their 2-minute take on [How to Shoot a Video for the Web Using a Flip Camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkrBtGpMNhI) covers the basics of framing, lighting, and sound specifically for Flip cameras similar to what we have available for checkout at the Library:

## But wait, there’s more

U.C. Berkeley’s Knight Digital Media Center shares a series of short, lighthearted Video Techniques tutorials. The material is written for filmmakers who have most likely moved on from Flip cameras to heavier equipment, but much of what’s written is universally applicable. The following topics will get you off to a good start:

It looks like a lot but, really, it’s not. The entries are short, often amusing, and you’re likely to learn at least one thing about video production that you didn’t already know.

## Photos as video

There are times when a story can’t be told effectively in full motion video. When this is the case, you can work with still photos and sound to create a slideshow format video. Let’s use the soccer game we dreamed up back in Step 2 as an example. Instead of using an action shot of the ball going into the net, you could cut to a still image of a newspaper, proclaiming the winner. Or a “team photo” of the winning team posing with a the championship trophy. You could overlay the end-of-game siren or crowd cheering to help illustrate this scene without shooting a single frame of video.

## Putting it all together

Above all else, shooting good video takes time. You’ll often find that even basic shots require reshoots and alternate takes to really be useful. Here are a few suggestions to make sure your time behind the camera is used efficiently:

1.  Review the New Video Monday and KDMC tutorials.
2.  Make note of how you’ll apply video techniques to the shots on your list. Optional, but helpful: Sketch out your framing and composition on paper using a storyboard template (available here).
3.  Practice the video techniques and review your footage before your location shoot. Shoot, reshoot, and learn from your successes and your mistakes.

Now, get out there and shoot some video (and/or still photos) in preparation for [Step 4.]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts/step-4-make-rough-edit)
