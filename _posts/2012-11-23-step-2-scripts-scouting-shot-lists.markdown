So you’ve hammered out your brilliant idea for what’s sure to be an amazing video. Now what? Before you start shooting you’ll want to get yourself organized. In Step 2 of this training program, we’ll focus on logistics – all the steps you’ll need to take to get your video from concept to reality.

## Writing a script

Now that you have your idea, it's time to write a script. How detailed or general you want to make your script is up to you. Some people may find that writing a detailed script and memorizing it is the way to go. Others will prefer to only write a general idea of what they are going to say and “wing it” when filming time comes. Either way, keep in mind that your video must be shorter than 5 minutes. You’d be surprised how much you can say in such a short span of time.

## Creating a shot list

Whether your script is very detailed or more of a general idea, you want to create a shot list. A shot list is simply a list of all of the shots you need to film to create your video. You can do this by reading through your script and taking note of how you want to visually represent your message. What do you want to see on the screen and how are you going to shoot it?

Here’s an example of a shot list for an action scene during a soccer game:

1. Panning, Wide angle shot of a soccer field
2. Tracking shot of Joe kicking a soccer ball toward the goal
3. Wide-angle shot of crowd on bench, rising to its feet
5. Close-up on Joe’s foot as it kicks the ball at the goal
6. Smash cut to white as foot makes contact

What happens next? Does Joe score a goal and win the game? Does Jenny block the shot? Do space aliens land on the field, rendering the competition irrelevant? *It’s all up to you.*

##Scouting your Locations

Before you start filming, you’ll also want to check out your locations. This will give you a better idea of how and when you’re going to shoot your video. Will your location have a lot of background traffic? If you’re shooting in a public place, like a park, restaurant, or (ahem) a library, you’ll want to find a time when traffic is relatively low so you don’t have any unwitting walk-ons.

Will you have to move around during the shot? You probably need to recruit a camera assistant. Are you in front of a window that will produce an unwanted reflection? Maybe you want to choose another angle. Scout your locations, and revise your shot list if necessary. Once you’ve finished with that, go through your script again, and make a note of what equipment you will need (tripod, camera, etc.) and what crew (if needed) you have secured.
